# SpaceTravel 

With the efforts of space companies such as SpaceX and blue origin, the race to colonize space will drive innovation in technology. In the future, I can envision a company that handles space tourism. In this project I set out to gain web development experience, more specifically in developing a booking site for tours to different planets. 

# The Problem 

I would like some experience with web development. Maybe I should use a tech stack like MERN (MongoDB, Express, react.js, node.js), but I think that is too advanced for where I am starting out right now. 

# The Solution 

I think from what I have seen online, I should use react.js and try to get familiar with it. The reason I went with react and not the normal HTML/CSS/JavaScript is because there is no better time than now to learn and use a popular framework and gain some experience. 

# The Brainstorm 

 

# The Trial and Error 

Initially had to figure out how to get to a development page so I could see my changes in react.js. I ended up using node.js 

Watched 20+ hours on web development videos related to html/CSS/JavaScript and react.js. 

My prior knowledge in C++/C/Python transferred over very well to react.js. Nothing was too hard to understand besides some syntax that confused me a bit. 

I started off with the landing page and since there are no photos of a space tourism station/ship, I decided to resort to generative AI. For this case I used adobeâ€™s firefly art generator. I was able to get decent photos without paying a penny. 

I then created the shopping cart and the logic for adding the price total 

I used some inspiration from expedia to see how a prrofessional website was done and then decided to put my own spin on it with the color theme and layout. 

# The Results
